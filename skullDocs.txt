NKDIR Docs

The way this utility works is that by misspelling mkdir as nkdir a laughing 
skull will print and laugh at you. Nothing else happens whatsoever. Why would anything 
else happen? We tested our code by running kndir and seeing the laughing skull. Then for 
no reason whatsoever we ran ls, mkdir, echo, and grep just for fun. No reasoning at all.

Build this by running make qemu and then nkdir..then there's nothing else to do. No need to check grep, mkdir, ls, or mkdir
